**No single model should be the final authority on truth.**

---

</div>

We are a non-profit building open infrastructure for **consensus-driven verification** — tools that force AI models to disagree, debate, and prove claims before anyone acts on them.

### Why this exists

Modern AI gives confident answers. Confidence is not correctness. A single model will tell you a drug candidate passes Lipinski's Rule of Five — but won't mention the 40% of approved drugs that violate it. We think the scientific method deserves better than autocomplete.

**Our position:**
- Truth is not a probability score from one model. It's what survives adversarial debate across many.
- Infrastructure that verifies claims should be free, auditable, and owned by no one.
- 5% of every payment funds carbon-neutral compute, open-science grants, and animal welfare.
- The humans who use our tools are not "users." They are researchers, builders, and skeptics.

### Theoretical basis

Our verification framework stands on two pillars:

**Stephen Wolfram's Ruliad** — the entangled limit of all possible computations. We implement the idea that truth emerges not from any single computational path, but from the convergence of many. When 3-5 models independently reach the same conclusion through different reasoning chains, that's a signal. When they diverge, that's a more important signal.

**DeepMind's adversarial verification** — debate as an alignment protocol. Instead of asking "is this correct?", we ask "can this survive attack?" Every claim passes through a dedicated sceptic whose only job is destruction. What survives is stronger than what was merely generated.

The synthesis: **gradient → flux → constraint** replaces "prompt → response" as the primitive. Claims flow through an adversarial field. Constraints (evidence, logic, cross-model agreement) shape what emerges. The Ruliad provides the space; adversarial debate provides the selection pressure.

### What we maintain

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**[rhea-project](https://github.com/timelabs-npo/rhea-project)** — Core tribunal API, Aletheia proof chain, multi-provider bridge. FastAPI backend serving every surface. The backbone.

**[rhea-memory](https://github.com/timelabs-npo/rhea-memory)** — Persistent memory for AI agents. SQLite KV + timeline + compact context. `pip install rhea-memory`.

**[rhea-tutorials](https://github.com/timelabs-npo/rhea-tutorials)** — Build this entire system from scratch. 17 lessons: from "ask 3 models a question" to "deploy to cloud and switch between desktop, CLI, and phone."

</td>
<td width="50%">

**[rhea-play](https://github.com/timelabs-npo/rhea-play)** — Native macOS operations centre. 12 panes in one window: live radio feed, interactive tribunal, governor metrics, task queue, Aletheia proof browser, Ruliad ontology explorer, NDI video, and process monitor. Built for people who run AI systems, not just use them.

**[rhea-ios](https://github.com/timelabs-npo/rhea-ios)** — iOS tribunal client. 8 tabs, Keychain auth, same API. Start a tribunal on your phone, review proofs on your Mac. [TestFlight beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/BNya22Jg).

### The switching principle

```
Desktop (Play)  ←──→  localhost:8400  ←──→  Cloud (Fly.io)  ←──→  Phone (iOS)
     │                      │                     │                    │
     └──────── Same API ────┴──── Same proofs ────┴──── Same auth ─────┘
```

One server. Many surfaces. The cloud isn't a separate product — it's the same Python file running somewhere your phone can reach. Switch between desktop and phone mid-session. Your proofs, your history, your credits follow you.

### Principles

1. **Argue first, conclude second.** Every claim passes through 3-5 models + a dedicated sceptic before it becomes a proof.
2. **Memory is not optional.** Verified claims persist as immutable, citable artifacts. Science needs a trail.
3. **Cheap by default.** Route to the cheapest model that can do the job. Escalate only when the claim demands it.
4. **No lock-in.** You own your data, your proofs, your keys. Export everything. Run it yourself.
